This is a simple React app that takes calendar data from TeamEngine and displays it to the user.

## About the app

To see the encrypted calendar entries, simply input the passphrase (which is, of course, secret) and press enter!
Users can choose between a "month" or "week" view.
Click on calendar entries to reveal more information.
Currently, there are just 4 calendar entries, all in the start of February.
